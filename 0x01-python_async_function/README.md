# Asyncio Program with Concurrent Coroutines

This project demonstrates how to execute an asynchronous program using asyncio, run concurrent coroutines, create asyncio tasks, and utilize the random module in Python.

## Requirements

### General

- All files should be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7.
- All files must end with a new line and be executable.
- Use pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x).
- Type annotations for all functions and coroutines.
- Documentation for all modules, classes, and methods.
- README.md file at the root of the project folder.

## How to Run

To execute the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the main Python script: `python3 main.py`

## Usage

- `main.py`: Main entry point of the program.
- `async_program.py`: Contains the async program logic.
- `concurrent_coroutines.py`: Demonstrates concurrent coroutines.
- `asyncio_tasks.py`: Illustrates how to create asyncio tasks.
- `random_module_usage.py`: Shows usage of the random module.
