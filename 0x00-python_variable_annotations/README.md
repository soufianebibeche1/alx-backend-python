# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations

## Description

This project focuses on implementing variable annotations in Python and understanding how to use them to specify function signatures and variable types. It also covers the concept of duck typing and how to validate code with MyPy.

## Concepts Covered

- Type annotations in Python 3
- Specifying function signatures and variable types with type annotations
- Duck typing
- Validating code with MyPy

## Resources

- [Python 3 typing documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
- [MyPy cheat sheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet.html)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain type annotations in Python 3
- Utilize type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
- Understand duck typing principles
- Validate code using MyPy

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7
- Files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A README.md file at the root of the folder of the project
- Code should use pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
- All files must be executable
- Module, class, and function documentation is mandatory

## Usage

- Clone this repository.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Execute the Python files using Python
